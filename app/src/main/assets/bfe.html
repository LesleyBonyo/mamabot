<h4>How to stop breastfeeding</h4>
<p>It's up to you and your baby to decide when you want to finish breastfeeding.

It's recommended that you breastfeed your baby exclusively (give them breast milk only) for the first six months of their life.

Breastfeeding still has lots of benefits for you and your baby after six months. It protects them from infections and there's some evidence that it helps them to digest solid foods. It also continues to provide the balance of nutrients your baby needs.

The World Health Organisation recommends that all babies are breastfed for up to two years or longer.</p>

<h4>Stopping breastfeeding</h4>
<p>There is no right or wrong way to stop breastfeeding. For lots of mothers and babies, stopping breastfeeding happens gradually as the child grows and eats more solid foods.

It's important that solid food shouldn't simply replace breast milk. There's evidence that breast milk may play a part in helping a baby's digestive system to deal with their first solids.

Once they are eating solids, your baby will still need to have breast milk or formula as their main drink up to at least their first birthday.

Cows' milk isn't suitable as a main drink for babies under one, although it can be added to foods, such as mashed potatoes.

Carrying on breastfeeding while giving your baby some formula can work very well.

Babies breastfeed for comfort as well as food. Phasing out breastfeeding gently will give you both time to get used to the idea. Stopping gradually will also help prevent problems like engorged breasts and mastitis.

You'll probably find it easiest to drop one feed at a time. It doesn't matter which feed you drop first, so it will usually be a case of how it fits in with your life. For example, some mothers may prefer to continue night feeds so their baby can still have the comfort at night.

If your baby is younger than one year, you'll need to replace the dropped breastfeed with a formula feed from a bottle or (if they are over six months) a cup or beaker, instead.</p>


<p>If your child is over one and having a variety of foods and drinks they won't need a replacement feed.

Once you and your baby are settled into a pattern of having one less breastfeed, possibly after 5-7 days, you can then think about dropping another one.

If you are trying to stop breastfeeding and having problems, you can get help and ideas from your health visitor or a breastfeeding specialist.</p>

<h4>Combining breast milk and formula</h4>
<p>Some women decide to combine breastfeeding and formula milk rather than stopping breastfeeding completely.

If you want to do this, it's best to wait until your milk supply is fully established. This can take up to six weeks.

You can start by replacing one of your baby's regular daily breastfeeds with a bottle – or, if your baby is over six months, a cup or beaker – of formula, instead.</p>

<h4>Common reasons for stopping breastfeeding</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sore or painful breasts</li>
<li>Some women find breastfeeding uncomfortable, especially in the early days and weeks. Common problems include sore or cracked nipples and painful breasts.</li>
</ul>
<p>These problems often happen when your baby is poorly attached to the breast. Your midwife, health visitor or a breastfeeding specialist can help you with positioning your baby and getting them properly attached.</p>

<h4>Not enough breast milk</h4>
<p>Lots of women worry that they haven't got enough milk when in fact they have plenty to meet their baby's needs.

Your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding specialist can also suggest ways to increase your milk supply if necessary. This could just mean making sure that your baby is well attached to the breast and that you are feeding often enough.</p>



<h4>Going back to work</h4>
<p>Going back to work doesn't necessarily mean you have to stop breastfeeding.

If your breast milk supply is well established, your work needn't impact on your milk supply for your baby. You can either express at work and give your breast milk to your child's carer or provide formula milk while you're away.

If your employer isn't familiar with the rules around breastfeeding and expressing in the workplace, it's worth sharing the ACAS guidance with them or contacting your union if you have one.</p>

<h4>Going on holiday</h4>
<p>As with work, going on holiday doesn't mean that you have to give up breastfeeding. In fact, breastfeeding can be more convenient while you are away.

You don't need to worry about boiling water and sterilising feeding equipment. Plus, if you're flying, there's no need to worry about restrictions on carrying bottles or cups of formula through airport security checks.

Breastfeeding also helps to equalise the pressure in your baby's ears on take-off or landing.</p>

<h4>Getting pregnant again</h4>
<p>If you get pregnant again while you are breastfeeding, it shouldn't affect your baby or the pregnancy. However, you may feel tired, and changes in your appetite and emotions can make breastfeeding more challenging.

In rare cases, women are advised to stop breastfeeding before getting pregnant again, particularly if they have previously had a miscarriage or premature labour.

This is because there is a possible risk the breastfeeding hormone oxytocin may cause contractions. It's worth speaking to your GP or health visitor before you make any decisions about stopping.

Don't be put off feeding an older baby and a newborn (tandem nursing). The more milk your babies take, the more your breasts produce, so it's perfectly possible to feed more than one baby.</p>

<h4>Restarting breastfeeding after stopping</h4>
<p>Stopping breastfeeding doesn't always have to be permanent, but starting again may take a lot of time and not everyone will produce enough to meet their baby's needs. It depends partly on how well-established your milk supply was already.

Stimulating your breasts by expressing and offering the breast to your baby regularly can help encourage your body to restart making milk.

Skin-to-skin contact with your baby can promote lactation (milk production) too.

You can ask your midwife, health visitor or a breastfeeding specialist for help if you would like to restart breastfeeding.</p>

<h4>Breastfeeding older children</h4>
<p>There's no reason why you shouldn't carry on breastfeeding your child into their second year and beyond. You and your toddler can carry on enjoying the benefits of breastfeeding for as long as you want.

Your toddler may also find breastfeeding comforting when they are ill or upset.</p>
